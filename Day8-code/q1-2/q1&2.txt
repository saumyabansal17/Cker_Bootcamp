The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that help store and manipulate groups of objects efficiently — such as lists, sets, and maps.

Advantages:
Reusability: Common data structures (like ArrayList, HashSet) are already implemented.
Performance: Provides optimized algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.).
Interoperability: Common interfaces (like List, Set, Map) make code flexible.
Reduced coding effort: No need to write data structure logic from scratch.

Vector is synchronized and slower, used in multithreading.
ArrayList is faster but not synchronized, good for random access.
LinkedList is better for frequent insertions and deletions.
HashSet stores unique elements without order and offers fast lookups.
